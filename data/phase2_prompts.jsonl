These special substrates have an invisible polymer coating that allows the chemical reaction to occur. Now previously we had been limited to what we can sublimate onto by these blanks and what was available - UNTIL NOW!\nThanks to the Subli Glaze line of aerosol spray coatings, the possibilities are near ENDLESS for what we can offer as far as sublimation products.\nEven dark or black objects can be sublimated onto with ease thanks to the white base coating spray that will allow the CMYK ink of the sublimation printer to do its job. The process for using this spray is very straightforward and anyone can begin spraying their own items in preparation for sublimation transfer printing.\nSubli Glaze is the only do-it-yourself sublimation coating that is designed to enable sublimation decoration on a wide range of surfaces such as ceramic, wood, glass, plastic, metal and even STONE. Users can coat substrates quickly and efficiently, making almost any surface sublimation ready!
